Hello, everyone. I'm glad you are here. 
How are you? I hope you all fine. 
I plan to talk about how to build my artwork print blog.
Today I'm still working at home and I want to introduce you to my artwork design. 
I love colors and do some experiments with some app that already out there, like Canva, and Canvas.
I create my artwork combine with digital technic and traditional. The artwork print on apparel, accessories, and room decor.
To make my artwork design worthy, and I put them in my store online.
